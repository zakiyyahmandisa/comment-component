# comment-component
To complete the assignment, please do the following:
1. Create a new local project that uses Vite, Prettier, and ESLint
2. Build a reusable comment component that meets these requirements:
     a. Uses Custom Elements
     b. Can take a name, email address, and comment as an attribute
     c. Display the name, email address, and attribute, in a custom layout thatâ€™s built-in to the component
3. Add 3-5 comment components to the page via HTML
4. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the web page should be separate files. Use JavaScript module syntax (ES Modules) for your JavaScript. HTML and CSS defined as part of a custom element do not need to be in a separate file.
5. Submit your code by pushing it to GitHub, ensuring that there are no Prettier or ESLint errors.
